== PostgreSQL client concurrency Benchmarking

What does this benchmark measure ?

Client latencies over a single connection to PostgreSQL using a bunch
clients under various concurrency configuration.

=== Running the benchmark

```
> mvn clean package
> java -jar target/benchmark.jar --connect-uri=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres "select from table where id=0"
```

The URI follows the LibPQ https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING[format]

Using a local PostgreSQL instance started by this tool when no connect uri is specified

```
> mvn clean package
> java -jar target/benchmark.jar
```

WARNING: the benchmark will run against localhost

By default tests run with the Reactive PostgreSQL client, you can also run with JDBC:

```
> java -jar target/benchmark.jar --client=JDBC "select from table where id=0"
```

You can set the number of times the statement is executed:

```
> java -jar target/benchmark.jar --count=5000 "select from table where id=0"
```

You can set the connection pipelining (exclusive to the Reactive PostgreSQL client):

```
> java -jar target/benchmark.jar --pipelining=10 "select from table where id=0"
```
